        <h1>Cleric</h1>
        <p>The cleric is one of the standard playable character class in the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game.[1] Clerics are versatile figures, both capable in combat and skilled in the use of divine magic (thaumaturgy). Clerics are powerful healers due to the large number of healing and curative magics available to them. With divinely-granted abilities over life or death, they are also able to repel or control undead creatures. Clerics also have specific 'domains' which usually align with the character's alignment and the god that cleric serves. Whether the cleric repels or controls undead is dependent on the cleric's alignment. It is the only class to be in every version of Dungeons & Dragons without a name change.[2]</p>
        
        <h2>Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition</h2>
        <p>The cleric was one of the standard character classes available in the original Player's Handbook.[5] The cleric was presented as one of the five core classes.[6]:145 The cleric's hit dice improved to a d8, first level clerics could now cast one spell, and the wisdom score now gave clerics a spell bonus while low wisdom gave a chance of spell failure.[7]

The speciality cleric and cleric spell sphere concepts were first introduced in the Dragonlance Adventures hardcover book (1987).</p>
        
        <h2>Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition</h2>
        
        <p>The cleric, as part of the "priest" group, was one of the standard character classes available in the second edition Player's Handbook.[5] According to the second edition Player's Handbook, the cleric class is similar to certain religious orders of knighthood of the Middle Ages such as the Teutonic Knights, the Knights Templar, and Hospitalers, which combined military and religious training with a code of protection and service. Archbishop Turpin (of The Song of Roland) is an example of such a cleric.[8] The Complete Priest's Handbook details priestly characters and religion in campaigns.[5]:109â€“110

The 2nd edition cleric could optionally choose to be a priest of a specific mythoi and pick a specific religion or mythos. Within the mythos or religion chosen by the character are abilities and powers, represented by the Spheres of Influence (Combat, Creation, Healing, Necromancy, Protection, Sun, Weather, etc.) defined by the worshiped deity's dogma (Tyranny, Death, Life, Healing, etc.), power (demi, lesser, intermediate or greater power), and alignment (Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil, etc.).

Further variant clerics were developed in Spells and Magic and Faith and Avatars, including the Crusader, Monk, Mystic, and Shaman.</p>
    
        
        <h2>Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition</h2>
        
        <p>In the 3rd Edition (and revised 3.5 Edition) of D&D the cleric must choose either a deity or an alignment concept to be dedicated to (the "patron"). The cleric's alignment must be within 1 step of their patron (e.g., for a Lawful Good patron the cleric can be Neutral Good, Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral). Notably, it is also stated that a cleric needn't worship a specific deity or have a religion at all, but can draw their power from a philosophy or even their personal devotion to a cause or way of life.

Divine spellcasting in 3rd Edition is dependent on Wisdom, which restricts the highest spell levels available to the cleric. Other useful abilities for the Cleric include Charisma, to bolster Turn/Rebuke Undead and Diplomacy checks, and Constitution, to complement their melee abilities by way of Concentration for defensive casting, and increased Hit Points.</p>
        
        <h2>Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition</h2>
        
        <p>The cleric's power source remains divine, and they fill the role of Leader. Their powers (called prayers) are mainly concerned with healing, protection and support; however, like most 4th edition classes, they gain the standard number of attack powers based on their level, and like all 4th edition classes, their attack powers generally include damage-dealing capabilities. Like Wizards, Clerics gain Ritual Caster as a bonus feat.

The Player's Handbook presents two Cleric builds, Battle Cleric, which focuses on offense, melee combat and Strength-based prayers, and Devoted Cleric, focusing on support, ranged combat and Wisdom-based prayers, many of the cleric's Strength and Wisdom based prayers have secondary effects related to Charisma.

Like paladins, clerics possess the "Channel Divinity" class feature and can use it for multiple functions, including Turn Undead and deity-specific powers.

The Player's Handbook includes four Cleric paragon paths: Angelic Avenger, Divine Oracle, Radiant Servant and Warpriest (later renamed Tactical Warpriest, to avoid confusion with the Essentials variant of the same name).

        <h2>Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition</h2>
        
        <p>The cleric has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook.[9] Players choose from one of seven Divine Domains when creating a cleric character: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide supplement adds the Divine Domain of Arcana to the possible options. Xanathar`s Guide to Everything adds the Divine Domains of Forge and Grave. Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica adds the Divine Domain of Order. In addition to those, the Dungeon Master`s Guide contains the Death Domain under the Villainous Class Options section.</p>

<p>Each Divine Domain gives the cleric different default domain spells. The Knowledge domain values learning and understanding, Life values healing, Light values rebirth and renewal, Nature values protecting the natural world, Tempest values the power of the natural world, Trickery values shaking things up and being disruptive (for good or evil) and War values fighting for his or her faith. Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide adds the Arcana domain which melds the power of the gods with magic. The Forge domain from Xanathar`s Guide to Everything focuses on creation and empowering weapons, while the Grave domain from the same supplement focuses on preserving the balance of life and destroying the undead. Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica adds the Order domain which represents discipline and devotion to society and law. The Death domain from the Dungeon Master`s Guide is intended for evil characters and is focused on death, necromancy and the undead.</p>
